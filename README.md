# **These are my five favorite sketches that I had made throughout the semester**


## 1. **My [first project](https://github.com/GhostOfTarkov/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s22magd150lab01_Walter_2022_04_28_23_03_53/sketch.js) that I ever created in P5.JS**

I chose this project because I wanted to show how what I did before I had learned some ways to make more unique sketches over time...

## 2. **My [third project](https://github.com/GhostOfTarkov/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s22magd150lab03_Walter_2022_04_28_23_05_30/sketch.js) that I created in P5.JS**

I chose this project because I had learned a lot about the points on the canvas and how to navigate it using numbers.

## 3. **My [sixth project](https://github.com/GhostOfTarkov/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s22magd150lab06_Walter_2022_04_28_23_05_32/sketch.js) that I created in P5.JS**

I chose this project because I tried to make something that was way past my ability at that time although I did learn a lot about how to make functions.

## 4. **My [seventh project](https://github.com/GhostOfTarkov/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s22magd150lab07_Walter_2022_04_28_23_00_33/sketch.js) that I created in P5.JS**

I chose this project because I had learned a lot about how to use the random method and also how to use classes and call functions in classes.

## 5. **My [tenth project](https://github.com/GhostOfTarkov/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s22magdlab10_Walter/sketch.js) that I created in P5.JS**

I chose this project because it was the latest projects we had and also I had learned how to use camera and lights with 3D objects.
